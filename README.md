# Sensor Data Analyzer (C++)

A simple C++ tool for analyzing aircraft engine sensor data.
Built to refresh core C++ skills and demonstrate basic data processing.

## Overview

This project reads a CSV file containing simulated flight sensor data (altitude, airspeed, oil temperature, vibration, fuel flow, etc.) and performs:

- Data parsing and validation  
- Per-flight-phase statistical calculations  
- Detection of abnormal engine conditions  
- Summary reporting

It is designed as a small example of aviation-focused data analysis.
